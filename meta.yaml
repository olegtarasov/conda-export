  summary: 'Platform agnostic conda environment export'
  description: |
    An alternative to `conda env export` that helps create portable environment 
    specifications with minimal number of packages. Resulting specification is 
    similar to `conda env export --from-history`, but also includes packages 
    that were installed using `pip`.
